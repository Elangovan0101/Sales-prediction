![Sales vs. Advertising Spend](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F644db582-bcf0-4315-b401-117262a1652a%2F170627-better-grocery-store-main-se-539p-2053956.jpg?table=block&id=9ed393fa-4cd0-4bb7-ba59-89f9a150a289&cache=v2)

## Dataset Description 📊

The dataset contains information about advertising budgets and their corresponding sales figures across different channels:

- `TV`: Money spent on TV advertising.
- `Radio`: Money spent on radio advertising.
- `Newspaper`: Money spent on newspaper advertising.
- `Sales`: Sales generated.

## Analysis Overview 🔍

This project aims to predict sales based on advertising expenditures across different media channels using regression models. Key steps include data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results.

## Key Findings 📊

1. **Model Accuracy**:
   - The model explains 91.4% of the variability in the training data and 87.3% in the test data.
   - MAE and MSE values indicate good prediction accuracy with slightly higher errors on the test data.

2. **Impact of Advertising Channels**:
   - **TV Advertising**: Highest impact on sales, making it the most effective channel.
   - **Radio Advertising**: Provides stable returns with less risk.
   - **Newspaper Advertising**: Lower impact on sales, suggesting less effectiveness compared to TV and radio.

3. **Recommendations**:
   - Increase investment in TV advertising for maximum impact.
   - Maintain stable investment in radio advertising for consistent returns.
   - Reevaluate newspaper advertising strategy and consider reallocating budget to more effective channels.

## Repository Structure 📁
